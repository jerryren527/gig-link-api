# Gig Link API

This repository contains the backend code for the Gig Link project, an online platform that connects freelancers and clients for project collaboration. The frontend code can be found in a separate GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/jerryren527/gig-link).

## Project Overview

Gig Link is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The backend code, found in this repository, serves as the API that facilitates data management, user authentication, and various operations required for the seamless functioning of the Gig Link platform.
